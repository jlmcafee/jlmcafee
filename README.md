I’m Jason McAfee.
My background is in chemistry and physics, specifically computational chemical physics. 

I have almost completed a MS in Advanced Data Analytics. I really enjoy looking at datasets and extracting logical information, without using models.
In the past, I wrote code in Fortran and relied heavily upon BASH to get my work done. I have been learning Python and R over the past year, and hope to continue
that trend, as well as adding SQL. 

I am actively looking for work in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
